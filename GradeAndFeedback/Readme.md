Thank you for your submission, Sam!

This is a really great website! Fantastic work!!! There are lots of great examples of your week-1 learning outcomes and you've produced a excellently styled website!! Multiple pages aren't usually something we see so early in the course, same for "back to the top" button and user forms! You're spoiling me!!! There are still some areas that are worth examining though!

## HTML:

I’m a big fan of the way you have structured your HTML file! You’ve followed best practices like including a <header>, <main> and <footer> element and you have nested your other elements inside appropriate containers throughout! The elements you have chosen to use like <nav> and <section> make good semantic sense and also follow the best practices we are looking for!

Some things to consider:

- Broken path -> games./games.html has an extra dot. It should be games/games.html.

- Multiple <h1>s -> You have an <h1> in the header and also inside sections. Keep a single <h1> for the page and the use <h2>/<h3> in content.

- Autoplay audio: Browsers will usually block autoplay with sound by default (thankfully!) so don’t rely on it. Well done for implementing the controls for the audio element though, another best practice!

## CSS:

Your CSS styling is really fantastic for someone at this point in the course! Nicely done!!! You clearly understand how to use a range of different CSS selectors and are also showing confidence in using layout properties like position:absolute and position: relative, flex and margin/padding. I really love your hover effects and also that you've used some properties we didn't cover in class like translate and box-shadow! In our next submission I would love for you to take your experimentation with an even wider range of CSS properties. Show me some funky stuff!!!
Some things to consider in your CSS:

- Fixed header overlap -> With a fixed .nav-bar, your first section element sits under it. Add top padding on the main element or scroll-margin-top on sections.

- Slightly stretched images -> height: 100% on full-viewport containers will usually result in stretched images. Add object-fit: cover to keep the aspect ratio.

- Color/contrast & hover: Nav links don’t set a base color by default, only a hover color. Make sure to set a readable default on the red bar.

- Font icon import: The Material Symbols import URL looks a bit weird to me (doesn't mean is not working though) with (icon_names=). The standard link element works reliably too.

## Reflection:

Thank you for providing such a robust and thoughtful reflection! It’s clear that you’ve carefully considered the successes and challenges that you faced and this will serve you very well as the course continues! This kind of reflection is EXACTLY what I would like to see from each and every student, keep it up!!! Infinite brownie points for the references section too! Magnificent work!

## Deployment:

You also successfully managed to deploy your website using Github pages! This is an important achievement and you should be very excited! This is the first of many examples of your great work heading out into the Wide World!

## Suggestions for next time:

I think it would be well worth digging into the specifics of complex CSS selectors a bit as your styling is of such a high quality. This would supercharge the specificity in which you can apply those amazing styles of yours! Check out:

https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/ (this content is very broad in scope, don't get lost down a rabbit hole!)

This is an outstanding piece of work and you should be very proud of yourself! We’re definitely proud of you!!
I’m giving you a 4 for this assignment as you have successfully implemented all of the core goals we were looking for but also went on to implement a big bag of very funky stretch goals!

Truly impressive work this week Sam, keep this momentum going!!! Well done!!!
