## Reflection

For Week One's assignment, we were asked to build a website using HTML and CSS while meeting the requirements given to us. I feel like I got along with the assignment pretty well and had a good understanding of how to do most of what was asked. I think I've managed to reach all the targets set and nearly all the stretch goals.
