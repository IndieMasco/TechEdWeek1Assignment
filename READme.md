## Requirements I Think I've Achieved

- I've used header, nav, and footer elements.
- Applied CSS absolute positioning to overlay text on an image.
- Utilized CSS Flexbox to create a flexible and responsive layout in the nav element.
- Ensured all image elements have correct src file paths.
- Implemented two back to top buttons. The first one is by clicking home and it will reload the page, and the second one is with a fixed button in the bottom right of the webpage.
- Enabled smooth scrolling.
- Added a hover effect on buttons for interactivity.
- Created a basic footer with social media icons linking to social media pages.
- added audio
- Added multiple extra page.

## requirements that I wasnt able to achieve

- I wasn't able to get the audio to autoplay. Everywhere I look online is saying that it's blocked by most browsers and it won't autoplay until the user has interacted with the page.

## Reflection

For Week One's assignment, we were asked to build a website using HTML and CSS while meeting the given requirements. I feel like I got along with the assignment pretty well and had a good understanding of how to do most of what was asked. I think I've managed to reach all the targets set and nearly all the stretch goals. I've also found it helpful to reach out to my peers, asking them questions, sharing ideas, and helping each other.

## Errors or Bugs I Encountered

- While putting the web page together, the first/top image kept overlaying my nav bar. It took me a while, but I found a way to fix it by putting z-index: 1; within .nav-bar in CSS.
- There were a couple of things that I thought were errors or bugs, but when I looked closely, it was because I had misplaced code. For example, my footer was a lighter red than all the other red, even though the color codes were the same. It turned out I had added some transparency, so it was mixing with the white background.
