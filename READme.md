## Requirements I think I've achieved

- Used header, nav, and footer elements.
- Applied CSS absolute positioning to overlay text on an image.
- Utilized CSS Flexbox to create a flexible and responsive layout in the <nav> element.
- Ensured all image elements have correct src file paths.
- Implemented a back to top button.
- Enabled smooth scrolling.
- Added a hover effect on buttons for interactivity.
- Created a basic footer with social media icons linking to social media pages.
